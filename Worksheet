## Review
1. What is your favorite CS topic you've learned so far?
My favorite CS topic has been if else statements. They are just fun and easy for me to understand and use.

## Exploration
2. What is the most difficult CS topic you've learned so far?
For loops are hard for me to understand sometimes. I can definitely use them effectively when I'm presented with a certain situation, but I have a hard time identifying how to construct for loops from scratch.

## Challenge
3. What do you most look forward to learning this semester?
I most look forward to learning about the most efficient ways to organize data, because I noticed that a lot of my code from last semester was really long.
